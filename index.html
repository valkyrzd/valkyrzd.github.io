		<h1> Live Action Anime</h1>
    <p>As soon anime was popularized in the west, there was a huge effort to bring these shows into a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/worst-anime-live-action-adaptations/" title="live action fails" target="_blank">live action</a> format. These attempts have largely fallen flat, minus a few exceptions, most recently being the One Piece live action released on netflix. 
			I do not understand why this is such a big trend, especially lately. Anime and, by extension, animation as a whole, is able to tell stories in ways that live action never could. Animation as a medium is able to arrange multicolored scenes that cgi could <strong>never</strong> do justice, and practical effects couldnt replicate it either due to the impossible nature of some of these shows.
		Live action shows drain the original work of everything that made the show special in the first place, and studios need to stop butchering these shows for the sake of putting them in a format they never should've been in in the first place.
